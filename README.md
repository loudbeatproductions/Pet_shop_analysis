# First glance:
![[Cost_&_Revenue_local.png]]
Taking a look at the sales by month it may seem the business is growing almost exponentially. But the economic situation in the country it operates is much more complicated. As we can see in the second graph, the local currency has been losing its value against a more stable asset like the US dollar.

To make things clearer, the sales are converted on a daily basis to USD to keep the devaluation of the local currency out of the way. After doing this we can see a small but steady grow in the last 3 years.

Its easy to notice also that looking at the entire data from mid 2016 that the growth in the last years is nothing more than a slow recovery of how the major political and economics events affect the overall cash flow of the country population and thus the clients of this particular business.

# Cost & revenue
![[Cost_&_Revenue_USD.png]]
There is a clear descent in the sales in anticipation of the presidential elections in 2019 when Alberto F. won. Both sales and revenue were roughly cut in half. Shortly after the pandemic hit the world and a quarantine was due in March 20. The combined scenario gave result to the lowest sales period seen by the business.
The slight upwards trend after that were caused by a careful and thorough work over the alternative products offered by the shop, finding better deals with known and new providers, adjusting margins and cutting expenses to try to increase the revenue to the previous values.

The decisions had lead to an excellent recovery, though the overall sales haven't reached the range seen in the 2017-2019 period.

The last descent seen between July-October 2023 can be explained by the huge monetary emission carried out by the current government to finance their political campaign for the coming presidential election. There is a quick "recovery" in the coming months, after the candidate Javier Milei gains strength, Most of the people started to buy out of the fear of an economic collapse given by the bad press it was raging at that moment.

# Profit percentage

Anticipation and doom market predictions for the possible outcome of the elections, together with the monetary emission from the current government has taken a toll in the sales amount up until December when the outcome is finally realized. There is a mild but steady decrease in the average profit of articles sold from the year 2022, which has been increasing up till reaching a 10% difference with the usual amount. Non essential articles like accessories and toys have a greater margin than essentials like pet food. Though accessories don't make the gross of the sales, they help to increase the profit amount the most. The last decreasing trend shows that clients are adjusting their standard of living to the major economic factors shaping the country, shifting sales to less profitable products like cheapest pet foods and no spares to spent on non essential stuff.

# Total sales & articles
![[Sales_Articles_Average.png]]
There is a trending decrease in the sales amount that happens mostly in January-February. This can be accurately explained by the heat season in which is accustomed to take vacations between those dates. Though the last season resulted to be the lowest thanks to everything it was explained before, along with the average of articles bought on each sale that also were the lowest ever seen.

# Sales / time of the day:
![[Sales_over_day.png]]
There is a shift in the client conduct regarding the busiest time of visit. The shop is open Monday to Saturday from 9:00 to 21:00. Hot months have more sales earlier in the morning with a peak around midday and a drastic fall before 2 PM followed by a linear increase after 4 PM until it peaks at around 8 to 8:30 PM. The sales rapidly decrease but there are still clients approaching up until 9:30 PM.
In contrast, colder months have up to twice as less visits in the early morning making a same peak at around midday. Continuing with twice as much sales on the lowest points and a more rapid increase after 4 PM making its peak at around 6 to 7 PM. Sales die out after that until there's barely any laggard passing 9 PM time.

# Sales by day:
![[Sales_by_day.png]]
The best selling days have molded out thanks to an external factor. There's a government promotion that offers a weekly refund on Wednesday and Thursday using the promoted payment method.

# Conclusion:
The commerce has shown an excellent resilience given the situation over the years. Keeping in mind that a lot of business have perished along the downs of the accompanying economy, it is a very good news to see it recovering the earnings of its best previous years.
However, due to the newly political change, added up to the huge monetary emission left out by the prior government, which would have a delayed effect, and the inherited debt and the severe adjustment they are making to avoid falling into a hyperinflation, the data shows a decrement in the purchasing power of its clients. They are changing to less expensive items that leave less profit and money.
It is advised to cut expenses to a minimum and find new products that could compete in the market with cheaper prices and higher profitability.
